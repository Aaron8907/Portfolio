# Homework 1

For this weeks homework I worked on creating a Portfolio using what I learned in the CSS Chapter, I also reviewed some online info to add the HTML code as I originally thought of.

## HTML

For the HTML:

* Added reset.css link
* Used anchor tag so when the user clicks on the nav bar options it will jump to that section
* Used alt attributes
* As I currently do not have any applications developed used images
* Used links to access LinkedIn, Github and to send an email
* Added contact form

## CSS
 For the CSS :

 * Used back-ground images to use a semitextured background
 * Used display flex
 * Used @media
 * Implemented many CSS styles learned
